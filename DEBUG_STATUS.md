Remove the timeout logic that fires immediately\n2. Simplify the results display to one clean listing\n3. Focus on copy/paste functionality\n\n## API Status\nThe API endpoint should be working - need to test the frontend processing flow.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Test the actual AI processing (without timeout interference)\n2. Simplify the results UI for better usability\n3. Ensure copy functionality works perfectly
